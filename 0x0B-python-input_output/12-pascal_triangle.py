"""
This code generates Pascal's triangle by first creating an empty list
for each row, then filling in the values for each element in the row
based on the values in the previous row. The first and last elements
of each row are always 1, and the other elements are calculated as the
sum of the two elements directly above them in the triangle. The triangle
is then printed with leading spaces to align the rows correctly.
